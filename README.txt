A simple project to use both Mars Weather APIs and Rover photo APIs to create an application in Flask 

Status
- This is currently INCOMPLETE. It does not run currently. 

Why?
- Increase understanding of APIs

Going Forwards
- Will be expanding this out to a wider weather / environmental application for space going forwards using APIs from other sources.
