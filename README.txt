A simple project to use both Mars Weather APIs and Rover photo APIs to create an application in Flask 

Status
- This is currently INCOMPLETE. It does not run currently.I am playing with the APIs currently. 

Why?
- Increase understanding of APIs

Steps
1. Understand information available from APIs
2. Design of Flask application interface
3. Ensure provision of data is updated real time

Going Forwards
- Will be expanding this out to a wider weather / environmental application for space going forwards using APIs from other sources.

Instructions
API KEY
1) Head to config file. Here you can see that the personal API key is pulled from and stored within the an .env file. 
2) Simply head to NASA https://api.nasa.gov/ and setup your own API key and insert this into a self-made .env file. The code will grab this itself.
